# Java OOP Examples – Worker, Rational, Money, Matrix, Employee

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts using five example class groups:

## 📦 Classes & Features

- **Worker** – Employee details, constructors, input/output methods.
- **Rational** – Fractions with arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- **Money** – Rupee–Paise representation with addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **Matrix** – 2D integer matrices with read/display methods and copy constructor.
- **Employee** – A console-based program to input and display employee data using different types of constructors and arrays of objects.

## 💡 Concepts Covered
- Encapsulation
- Constructor overloading
- Copy constructors
- Method overloading
- Arrays of objects
- Custom data type operations

## ▶️ How to Run

Compile and run each driver class using the following commands:

```bash
javac Classjava/*.java
java Classjava.Work
java Classjava.UseRational
java Classjava.UseMoney
java Classjava.UseMatrix
```

### 👨‍💼 For the Employee Program (Package: `Assignment1`)
```bash
javac Assignment1/Employee.java
java Assignment1.ApplicationOfEmployee
```

⚠️ **Note:** The Employee program uses `System.console()` which does **not work in IDEs**. Run it from a terminal/command prompt. To make it work in IDEs, consider replacing `System.console()` with `Scanner`.

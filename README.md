# Java OOP Examples – Worker, Rational, Money, Matrix, Employee, HeartRate

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using six example class groups.

## Classes & Features

- **Worker** – Employee details, constructors, input/output methods.  
- **Rational** – Fractions with arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  
- **Money** – Rupee–Paise representation with addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  
- **Matrix** – 2D integer matrices with read/display methods and copy constructor.  
- **Employee** – Console-based program to input and display employee data using different constructors and arrays of objects.  
- **HeartRate** – Calculates a person’s age, maximum heart rate, and target heart rate range based on date of birth and current year.  

## Concepts Covered

- Encapsulation  
- Constructor overloading  
- Copy constructors  
- Method overloading  
- Arrays of objects  
- Custom data type operations  

## How to Compile and Run

### 1. Compile and run general class examples:
```bash
javac Classjava/*.java
java Classjava.Work
java Classjava.UseRational
java Classjava.UseMoney
java Classjava.UseMatrix

2. Employee Program (Package: Assignment1)
javac Assignment1/Employee.java
java Assignment1.ApplicationOfEmployee

3. HeartRate Program (Package: Assignment1)
javac Assignment1/DateOfBirth.java
javac Assignment1/HeartRate.java
javac Assignment1/HeartRateApplication.java
java Assignment1.HeartRateApplication

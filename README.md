# Java OOP Examples – Worker, Rational, Money, Matrix

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts using four example class groups:

## Classes & Features
- **Worker** – Employee details, constructors, input/output methods.
- **Rational** – Fractions with arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- **Money** – Rupee–Paise representation with addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **Matrix** – 2D integer matrices with read/display methods and copy constructor.

## Concepts Covered
- Encapsulation
- Constructor overloading
- Copy constructors
- Method overloading
- Custom data type operations

## How to Run
Compile and run each driver class:
```bash
javac Classjava/*.java
java Classjava.Work
java Classjava.UseRational
java Classjava.UseMoney
java Classjava.UseMatrix
